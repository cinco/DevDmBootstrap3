## DevDmBootstrap3

This is a starter WordPress theme for DEVELOPERS using Twitter Bootstrap 3.3.6.

A lot of folks have been saying that there isn't a good theme out there for developers as most themes are trying to cater to the average Joe. Many available themes (even starter themes) are all full of bloated shortcodes and frameworks that make zero sense. This is my answer to that. I was very pleased with my 2.3.2 version so here is to a bright future using 3.x.

With “Swatcher” I’ve incorporated all 16 Bootswatch themes. You can easily switch between them with the WordPress theme customizer. This gives you the ability to rapidly transform any DevDmBootstrap3 project into something fresh and new within minutes. Check out the website [http://devdm.com/devdmbootstrap3-swatcher/](http://devdm.com/devdmbootstrap3-swatcher/) for a demo documentation about all of the NEW tools available to you. We are really pushing the limits of the Theme Customizer here and I am excited for it!

Swatcher is an elaborate example of what can be accomplished with WordPress child themes and a little elbow grease.

The 'cleanblog' child theme introduces a few different features that can turn your DevDmBootstrap3 enabled theme into a nice clean blog style.  It also incorporates many of the features that DevDmBootstrap3 users have asked me about implementing over the last year. To see a demo of it in action visit [http://devdm.com](http://devdm.com).
